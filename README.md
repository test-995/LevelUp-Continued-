Original mod notes (1.4):

This mod introduces a health levelling system. Start as a Level 0 Colonist and work your way up to the doomsday launcher absorbing Level 100 Pirate Boss!

Added: No longer effective on pawns that are not the player so end game modded factions don't become invulnerable bullet sponges while you're trying to kill them if your settings have a low leveling threshold

I'm happy to delete this file if the original mod author updates theirs and requests this one taken down.
